## Description

Square Meal is a mobile-responsive, recipe search application. The application utilizes the TheMealDB API to access over 250 meals and recipes from around the world. From succulent Honey Teriyaki Salmon to creamy Prawn and Fennel Bisque, the mouth-watering possibilities for one's next meal idea are unending!

## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to search a meal name to find matching recipes
SO THAT I can use the provided instructions to make the meal.
```

## Features of the Application

```
GIVEN a recipe search application
WHEN I input the meal name into the search bar
THEN I am presented with pictures of recipes with matching names on the DOM.

WHEN I hover over the picture of the searched meal
THEN the name of the meal will be displayed.

WHEN I click on the picture of the searched meal
THEN further details about that meal will be displayed (category, cuisine, instructions, etc.).

WHEN I click on the "random" button (adjacent to the search bar)
THEN the application will fetch and display a random meal.
```
